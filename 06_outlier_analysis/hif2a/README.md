- ligands:
  - lig_237:
    It seems like one stereocenter next to the hydroxyl group has the wrong configuration, see [Dixon, Darryl David, et al. "Aryl ethers and uses thereof." U.S. Patent No. 9,908,845. 6 Mar. 2018.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9908845B2). The alternative conformation is lig_237_alt.

- edges:
