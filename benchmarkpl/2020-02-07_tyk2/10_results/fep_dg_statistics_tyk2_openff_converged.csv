# Statistics for target tyk2 and method openff_converged compared to exp. values:
# RMSE: root mean square deviation
# MUE: mean unsigned error
# R2: coefficient of determination
# rho: Pearson's correlation coefficent
# KTAU: Kendall's tau
# mle: maximum likelihood estimate
# stderr: standard error
# mean: average result of bootstrap samples (1000)
# low: lower bound of 95% confidence interval
# high: higher bound of 95% confidence interval
